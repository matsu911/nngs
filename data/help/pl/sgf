Usage: sgf [username]

This command is a handy way to get the last few games that a player has 
played so that you can email them to yourself.

Example:

sgf pem
Completed games for pem:
              xsl-pem-31-20-35          fanzhen-pem-01-19-09
Found 2 completed games.

If you wanted a copy of the match between xsl and pem, you would type:

mail me xsl-pem-31-20-35

Or, NNGS now uses a better filename convention:

sgf pem
Completed games for pem:
           pem-kenw-9509201448
Found 1 completed games.

so you would type:

mail me pem-kenw-9509201448
