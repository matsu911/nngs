    aban: Revoke logins from `banned' IP-number-ranges.

RESTRICTED TO ADMINISTRATORS.

USAGE: aban [+-*/?!] [ipnumber|name] [ipnumber]

  aban := show banned ip-ranges

  aban + <range> := add a range to be banned.

  aban - <range> := remove a range to be banned.

  aban * <name> := add a player's ipaddres to banned ranges.

  aban / <name> := remove a player's ipaddres from banned ranges.

  aban ? <range> := check if range is currently beeing banned;
                  report (connected) players in range

  aban ! := remove current sessions from banned ip-ranges


`iprange' can be either a range, or a single ip-address.

  Overlapping or touching ranges are automatically combined,
removing a range from the middle of an existing range will
cause it to be split in two.

 The ranges are maintained in memory, a persistent copy is also
kept in a file, which is read at startup. When ranges are altered
(using one of the +-*/ commands) , aban does not affect connected
sessions. Use `aban !' explicitely to remove these.
