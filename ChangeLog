*** Don't forget to change AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([nngssrv], [1.1.1]) ***
*** then re-run autoconf to regenerate configure from configure.in ***


1.1.22 AvK 2007-02-24, 2009-05-20, 2009-08-30
- added more configuarable items:
  - idle_check_interval
  - ratings-intervals
  - max_idle
  - max_login_idle
  - rating_read_interval
  - ladder_sift_interval
  - conffile.default_komi19
  - conffile.default_komi13
  - conffile.default_komi9
- changed rdbm_open()s to use xyfilename() instead of hard-coded pathnames.
- idem xystat() for nratingsfile.
- fixed missing spaces in install-scripts for datafiles/directories.
- replaced all references to [v]snprintf() by my_[v]snprintf()
This was needed because the library-functions MAY return values >= dstlen.
- introduced automatic creation of admin-account
- removed various function-static buffers
- instead added utils.c/poolstr_dup() as a poor man's garbage collector.
- allow logfile to have the datetime at the beginning of the lines,
instead of at the end.
- refixed missing space in install-data shell scripts.

1.1.21 AvK 2007-02-21
- added default_komi and default_komi9 to configurable items.
- silly tell-command returned prematurely.
- Say/tell/shout/kibitz/channel/etc-Formatstrings. Sigh.
- Removed some more double-indexing of [pg]array.
- (GIFU2006) fixed bugs that were introduced (in 1.1.15??) 
by changing calloc() -->> malloc(); added some memset()...
- use server_http (instead of hardcoded nngs.cosmic.org) in last line
of usage-command.
- added handling of dotted quad in lists/ban file
- network.c : netstruct.in_full is never set to anything != zero.
plan to reuse it.
- moved more tunable constants to the conffile.
- added fromport (portnumber) into netstruct.
- changed return form xystat() to be st_size iff stat() returns >=0
- changed player_write() to only clear is_dirty if file was written
succesfully. (defined by newsize > oldsize/2, which seems fair enough).
This will result in NNGS to retry writing if previous writes were
unsuccessful (caused by disk-full conditions).
Previously, playerfiles could get truncated on disk-full conditions.

1.1.20 AvK 2005-10-19
- removed a silly bug (looking for a sentinel in command_list, while there was
no sentinel. Problem was that it compiled fine on my home machines (probably
cause of padding/packing/alingment of global variables)
(thanks to  Guoliang Cao for reporting it, and insisting on it beeing fixed!)
- removed vsnprintf() <--> Logit() mutual recursion. Sigh.
- added some language subdirs to the CVS
- added want_fork and want_mail_child - booleans, for ease of running under a debugger.
- fixed incorrect incorrect handling of NULL-configurationstrings.
1.1.19_1 AvK 2005-10-15
- fixed missing language-subdirs for help and ahelp. Don't mention the war!
- fixed handling of empty chroot_xxx variables
- removed reference to memory - subdir (now considered obsolete)
- removed libladder. It's functions now live in ordinary objects
- changed NNGSRATED #define to 0 (zero) -->> Default: no need for mlrate
1.1.19 AvK 2005-10-11
- removed unnecessary extern from function declarations in headers.
- renamed the ladder functions. They all start with ladder_ now.
- renamed globals in mink.c to mink_*
- Added support for chroot(). Set CHROOT_DIR to empty if you don't want it.
  - chroot/fork will probably only work on unix/linux platforms.
    windows people don't seem to need security, anyway.
  chroot() involves a lot of changes.
  - the tempfile-mechanism needs a /tmp/ subdirectory in jail.
  for safety: if chroot is wanted but impossible: nngssrv should fail.
  sending mail from the program needs to be changed for chroot():
  a direct client to a SMTP 'mta' needs to be set up. (the mail-binary needs
  access to the / or /usr filesystem anyway.
  - sending mail by SMTP needs gethostbyname(), which needs /etc/resolv.conf
  and/or/ /etc/hosts, which should be present in the jail, and need to
  be copied there. a working DNS will also be needed, if mail is
  realayed to any other MTA than "localhost"
  because mail can block (either way ...) a separate spooling mechanism
  plus a child-process are needed.
  - chroot/smtp will *probably not work on windows*.
- new files : conffile.[ch].
  All the pahnames/strings/configuration-items are now kept
  in a configfile (textfile) , which is read at startup.
  a Fixed filename 'nngs.cnf' is assumed (from current directory)
  , an alternate path/file can be specified by a '-c path/file' option
  on the commandline.
  If no conffile is found, a nngs.cnf IS WRITTEN in the
  current directory. This will contain the "compiled in" pathnames.
  This file is intended to serve as a template for further customisation.
  Note: not all combinations of pathnames are valid, but it will now be
  -at least- possible to put the data and binary into separate locations
  , and split the data into 'constant' files (eg helpfiles) and
  'variable' (players/games/results) parts.
  - started to put boolean variables into conffile (allow_unregistered)
- changed some of the configuration-items (filename-suffixes)
  to "non configurable", and dropped them from autoconf.
- changed LOG_FILE//log_file to contain the full pathname. Now you can put
  the logfile anywhere you want.
  The logfile.portnumber-feature has been removed. If you want it, you'll
  have to edit the conffile.
- idem for logons
- New files udp_command.[ch] An attempt at udp interface.
  This is intended for a PHP web interface on a "local" machine. Putting a
  "standard" client interface into PHP (including login/password: persistent
  sessions) was too hard for me.
  The protocol is basically "commandline over datagrams" which seems
  silly at first glance, but it works. Great tool for monitoring/debugging
  an active server, too.
  The udp-socket normally binds to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) port 9696/udp,
  this to avoid unnecessary vulnarabilities.
- Player-db rework. Sorting out the variables into "persistent" and
  "session-instanciated" variables (which *should* behave different on when
  swapping slots) Found some variables that where never even referenced or
  used :-] Moved fields into substructs && massive renaming.
- more renaming ... trying to get rid off 1-letter variables && double
- added some comment on ip_ban.c, which I am very fond of...
  indexing.

1.1.18 2005-07-13 AvK
- removed excessive debugging in the log file
- nrat/ contents moved to src/ changes to makefiles//config
  Had to ask sourceforge.net crew to fix this in the CVS
- Attributions && Credits ...
- renames:
  - player_forget() to player_unfix(), which is more appropriate
  - misc variables in playerd/gamedb (flags.is_rated,is_client)
  - changed some more booleans to bitfields (dNd --> is_private)
  - some of the #defines: PAIR --> WANT_PAIR
- Bugfix: find_part_login() when there was an exact + one or more partial
  matches, it returned -2. It now returns the exact match, once there is one.
- combined game.{Teach/Teach2} variables into .teach.
  still allowing teach2 variable when reading game from file.
  [this will disappear, eventually]
- cleaned up network.c
  - changed lots of "else if" in main loop to "continue"
  - cleaned up telnet IAC-processing
  - Attempt to remove some duplicated code
  - Used fd_top+1 as first arg for select()
  - (style) replaced silly enum by OldFashioned Defines ...
- cruft removal
  - removed (()) parenthesis
  - replaced some if()if(b) -->> if (a && b)
  - some more (p == NULL) -->> (!p)
- tabs/spaces/indent
- removed ADMIN_LEVELS. They are always enabled, now.
  If you dont want them: dont use them. They wont harm you.

1.1.17 2005-05-25 AvK
- lots of timing/byo-yomi. Changed all of the timekeeping to
  0.1 second ticks. Only filedates/logons/gamestarts are still time_t.
  Timekeeping is basically done on the "heartbeat". This goes
  for all the "active" games, whether they will receive a move on
  this select() event or not. The heartbeat can only apply the 1st
  byo, afterwards the the move will do the checking (+foldover of byo).
- changed one of the two info-strings to:
  "You have 5:00 minutes and 25 stones", which seems more appropriate.
  Hope that won't break clients...
- the usual renaming of variables.
- autoconf/aautomake seem to have been changed. Again.
- changed the ugly macros in language.c. Still ugly.

1.1.16  2004-11-21 AvK

- Lots of autoconf/automake stuff fixed in data/ dir
  (install appeared to work only on linux platforms)
- Removed [0-9] from one-letter-subdirectories in {player,games,
  cgames,player_data}. Names are not allowed to start with a digit.
- Added {cgames,player_data} to installation makefiles.
  Still more to go; I added missing.h file to supply missing prototypes
  ([v]snprintf, popen,pclose, random)
- Changed most of the buffers in network.c (back) to signed char.
  The only place where an unsigned char is needed, is in the telnet IAC-
  handling. Also changed some pointers (into the inputbuffer) to offsets.
- Added a clumsy-but-fully-functional implementation for [v]snprintf()
  in src/utils.c. Tested on TRU64 (aka OSF1) V4.0. It works.
- changed default setting for want_adminlevels to yes.

1.1.15  2004-11-03 AvK

- Corrected clock-keeping (black's 1st move used white's clock ...)
  (this was caused by 'courtesy' for handicap, which is negotiated before
   black's first move)
- #ifdeffed out by WANT_HANDICAP_COURTESY (defaults to 0)
- renamed struct player.[bw]xxxx variables; put all repeating
  group-variables for [bw] into (sub) structs for [bw].
  (this makes the patch rather large :-)
- combined .inbyo and .numovertime members:
  a player is "in byo yomi" iff his numovertime > 0.
- fixed if(timeleft==0) where if(time_type==0) was meant.
- uncommented a call to game_update_times(): observers now get the
  correct time
- fixed filename-generation, including links.
- In previous versions, some of the pathname-construction seem to have
  been damaged ...
  The current implementation stores two links to the sgffile:
  (for players "Jimmy White" && "Karen Black")
  .../b/jimmy-karen-20040919
  .../k/jimmy-karen-20040919
  The same for the stored/unfinished jimmy-karen versions
  stored/sgf/"mail me" work now!
  'stored' , 'load' , 'sgf' , 'results' commands work now (for both players)
   xyfopen(FILENAME_CGAMES_bs_s_s, "w", wname, bname, fdate);
   xyfopen(FILENAME_CGAMES_ws_s_s, "w", wname, bname, fdate);
  now refer to the filename for black/white's perspective, respectively.
- replaced some more sprintf(fname, "%s/player_data/%c/%s.%s"
  by xyfilename()
- changed semantics of pmailfile(). It now just takes subject and pathname.
  No more filename construction inside.
- changed [bw]player(). these are used to extract playernames from
  pathname. rather clumsy.
- changed some of the historyfile modes back to "a" :-[
- fixed parray[] freeslot allocation problems. boot_out() now
  works as expected.
  - created player_find_sloppy(), player_write()
    , player_swap(), player_swapslots() functions
  - added comment to playerdb.h to document cacheing.
  - player_zero() now only has one argument.
  - removed excess player_forget() in com_nuke()
- Login/logout is now recorded properly.
- added #if ALL_USERS_ARE_REGISTERED to remove lines that served
  my "lazy testing" attitude :-] .
  per default, the server now stores games FOR REGISTERED PLAYERS ONLY.
- Fixed the "black 1st move stealing time from white" -bug.
- fixed ignored EPIPE in select/read. Defunct connections now are
  properly shut down.
- added aban command for banning ipranges: connections from
  banned ip-addresses are closed immedately after accept(). See ahelp aban
  - new files: src/ip_ban.[ch]
  - (admin) command
  - support functions
  - ahelp - file
  - .../lists/ban[.default] : persistent storage for the ban list.
- revised host/network byte order. Variables are always in host order
  , until they are handed to/from the network layer.
- changed some of the network functions to return void
- changed the default for MODE_FOR_DIR back to 0.
  Now, the server is not supposed to create any directories.
- Replaced all exit() calls by main_exit()
- The gettimeofday() function won't accept the 2nd argument anymore.
  changed it to NULL.

[stylistic/cleanup]
- renamed the player_array-bitfields to {is_valid,is_dirty,is_connected,...}
- grouped the variables for b/w into a repeating-group struct.
- removed leading underscores from #defines (are reserved for library-use)
- fixed most of the 'const' warnings. Builds cleaner now!
- changed some indexes to unsigned to avoid
  'compare signed to unsigned'- warnings
- Changed some more "if (*string != '\0') {}" into "if (*string) {}"
- added string.h // strings.h, changed their order,
- added hard-coded prototypes for snprintf/ftruncate/popen/pclose/strcasecmp.
  This seems to be a header/ac/am problem, but I don't want
  to understand ac/am ...
- removed some commented-out code.
- removed/changed some hostnames/emailadresses from cosmic.org
  to localhost. Just to avoid flooding the wrong victims...
- removed unused argument from create_new_gomatch & game_write_complete()
  Seems to have been FICS heritage...
- changed some more XXXSIZE constants by sizeof, where appropriate.
- changed some functions to return void; where appropiate.
- added the users&admins to the README
- put net_close() into process_disconnection() They were always used together.
- added % and \\ to list of characters we don't want in filenames
- renamed com_check{PLAYER,IP,SOCKET}() to com_chk_player() et.al.
- changed dotQuad() to be a _just_a_bit_more_ re-entrant ;-}
- removed redundant c++ stuff from emote.h
- rewrote some double indexing [[]], (which hurts my eyes)
- replaced some calloc()s by malloc()s
- added some goto's for readability 8-}
- removed cruft from playerdb.h
- whitespace :-]
- misc changes (renamed some variables :-)

1.1.14  2002-07-24
- NOTE: using gcc-3.1.1 gives many new 'implicit declaration' warnings
- added check for endian.h (used in src/utils.c)
- updated for mlrate-1.1.0
...OLD mlrate versions are now incompatible with NNGSSRV!!
...major change: rdbm_open has new second arg: 1=write, 0=read
...note: there are no redb_store calls, so I opened all files '0'
- main patches leading to nngs1.1.14: (all by AvK)
- (renamed)
  - #defines:
    TYPE_GO -->> GAMETYPE_GO, etc
    MAX_PLAYER -->> PARRAY_SIZE, removed duplicate definition...
    net_maxConn -->> CONNECTION_COUNT
    net_maxListen -->> LISTEN_COUNT
  - variables/functions :
    gamedb.c: send_goboard_to() x ->> yy
    network.c: i -->> fd
    network.c: conns[] -->> netarray[]
    parray.state -->> parray.protostate
    parray.fullName -->> parray.fullname
    parray.status -->> parray.pstatus, PLAYER_FREE -->> PSTATUS_FREE,etc
    garray.status -->> garray.gstatus, GAME_FREE -->> GSTATUS_FREE,etc
    p_num -->> parray_top
    g_num -->> garray_top
    garray.Title -->> garray.gtitle
    carray.Title -->> carray.ctitle
    player_find() -->> player_find_fd()
- (big)
  - made parray[] into a cache for both connected and unconnected players
    - added the slotstat struct with bitfields for slotstate and LRU
    - .registered field moved to slotstat.
    - changed get_empty_slot
    - changed all references to parray to use the new fields
    - changed most tests on parray.status to instead use
      - parray.slotstat.inuse (slot occupied)
      - parray.slotstat.active (player is connected)
      - parray.slotstat.online (player is connected and logged on)
      - (pstatus= PSTATUS_LOOKING) no longer used, removed #define
    - new functions to remove the need for (p<0) playernumbers:
      - player_fetch() for lookups; replaces player_search()
      - player_forget() to decrease reference-count after use
      - player_dirty() to touch dirty-bit
    - changed most instances of player_save() to player_dirty()
    - new function player_dumpslot(int p) for use in Logit() etc.
  - compacted cmd_tell(), renamed it to do_tell(), integrated do_beep
  - bloat-reduction: (re)merged com_gmatch() com_tmatch() and com_gomatch()
    they now all call com_xmatch() ...
  - new file: nrat/pending.[ch]
    rewrote pending-stuff. Replaced the per-player arrays of pending structs
    by one global linked list of them. Also removed the (need for) duplicates
    of pendings (both the "from" and the "to" player had a copy).
- (small)
  - fixed "toggle quiet" BUG
  - fixed ": unknown command" BUG
  - fixed fd-leaks in game_read() and game_save()
  - removed sentinel from command_list and friends. fixed off-by-one error.
  - introduced global timevariable lastClock (mainly maintained
    by select-loop) and removed most of the systemcalls to time()
  - introduced an index-array to speed up socketfd-->>parray slot lookups.
    player_find_fd() uses this index
  - compacted who_ok()
  - new function parse_rank() to translate {12,k} into {19}, etc
  - rewrote the silly parsing in com_ranked()
  - compacted com_spair()
  - replaced endiantest in dotQuad() by !(BYTE_ORDER==LITTLE_ENDIAN)
    , this needs <endian.h>
  - allow NULL struct stat argument to xystat() (if for exist only)
  - changed logging of "input from fd not in parray" stuff
  - replaced some -1 by COM_BADFD, where appropriate :-)
  - added CODE_CR1 sendcode. It can ber OR'ed with a normal sendcode,
    and results in a \n being prepended to the sendcode.
  - introduced MIMIC_NNGS_1205 for cosmetic regression testing
  - modified and reinstalled SIGPIPE-handler. Maybe because of
    the supernatural speed, automated testing occcasionally still
    yields an uncaught SIGPIPE. Could be two fd's closing within the
    same select()-tick.
  - replaced [r]index() (which is a BSD-ism) by str[r]chr() (which should
    be standard C).
  - changed datetime in filenames for games (ccyymmddhhmm) to be UTC.
  - file_[bw]player treat their arg as const; skip leading directory,
    return pointers to static buffers.
  - replaced strcmp() by strcasecmp() when reading player data.
  - fixed coredump in com_logons()
  - added servername + version to com_uptime() - output.
- (misc)
  - rewrote some heavily indented nested if/else's
  - some indentation
  - changed some (xx==0) to (!xx)
  - changed some '\0' into 0
  - changed all sizeof(TYPE) to sizeof variable.
    (technically, this should be "sizeof lvalue", I think)
  - changed some sizeof(variable) to sizeof variable
    (there is no precedence lossage possible, here)
    NOTE p = malloc(sizeof *p) is less dependent on future typo's
  - removed some commented-out code
  - removed some outdated comments
  - got rid of most of the "const" warnings.
    added "const" to some function arguments.
  - SGF:
    - changed sgf to write CP[CoPyright...] instead of CoPyright[...]
    - added FF[4], AP[name: version] properties.
  - added socket-fd to login/logout Logit()s
  - changed some local functions to static
  - replaced some subscript-range tests to use COUNTOF() instead of
    a constant
  - introduced IFNULL(a,b) macro for conveniance
  - com_uptime() fixed. count_players() + count_games()
    all-time-high depended on left-to-right evaluation of function-args.
  - removed excess parenthesis, eg in return(xx);
  - replaced some explicit prompting by calls to pcn_out_prompt()
  - updated BUGS+README
- (future)
  - Added stuff to TODO :-(
  - I want unregistered players to be just another level (the lowest)
    of ADMIN_LEVEL.
    In the new system ADMIN_UNREG=1. ADMIN_REGISTERED=2.
    ADMIN_USER=0 is kept to promote previous enumeration to the new one.
    In the future, the meaning of slotstat.registered will be restricted to
    "has to be saved in file"


1.1.13  2001-12-03
- readded sys/time.h in utils.c for timezone definition
- added TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME includes in network.c, utils.c
- fixed 'coredump in moves command when in client mode' bug
- added avk to AUTHORS file (finally :)
[avk]
- utils.c: pxysend_file(): replaced printf(stderr,...)  by Logit() to logfile.
- replaced FORMAT_ by FORMAT_empty. points to "", so no need to translate :-)
- replaced literal 2 by MIN_NAME in name length check.
- savechar() et.al: replaced silly or-list by strchr()/strcspn() calls.
  put bad characters in unsafechars[] array;
- misc stuff:
  - removed some commented out code
  - etc



1.1.12  2001-10-09
- checked for sys/times.h and added it to nrat/gamedb.c for time_t def
- check: sys/stat.h utime.h errno.h ctype.h netdb.h arpa/inet.h
         arpa/telnet.h signal.h
- update to work with autoconf 2.52, automake 1.5
- updated almost all includes to use autoconf confirmed files
- removed sys/time.h sys/times.h and replaced with time.h  This should
  be enough and is the 'correct' way to include these.
- removed sys/dir.h from configure since its not used.
- updated includes in header files to use config.h defs
- NOTE: ALL includes (except the really basic ones without which the
  system would be unusable, i.e. stdio, stdlib, etc.) should be in the
  configuration preprocessor directives and have configure checks.
[mgrant]
- added AC_CHECK_TYPE (ulong,unsigned long)
- added #include <config.h> in mink.c
- fixed the netinet/in.h include in configure.in



1.1.11  2001-10-08
- small dirclose bug fixed in language.c
[AvK]
Some minor changes, mainly to src/mink.[ch]
- replaced "typedef struct { ... } name;" by "struct tag { ...};"
  similar changes in all corresponding references(eg function prototypes)
  IIRC, the "tagless structure" is a (Microsoft extension to C.
  NB the typedef is not needed. Most sourcefiles (that #include the .h file)
  only need the function prototypes. In these cases, inclomplete types will do.
- replaced 'ulong' by 'xulong', added typedef for xulong.
  this should stop us depending on /sys/types.h for ulong
- Misc stuff:
  - removed some more casts of [mc]alloc()'s return value type.
  - changed some "sizeof(type)" into "sizeof name"
[mgrant]
- NOGUEST and RESTRICTED_REGISTRATION defines in nngsconfig.h
- saved game load bugfix



1.1.10  2001-07-18
- changed help dir installation privs to 755
- typed 'char' to 'int' to get rid of warnings where necessary (is*(); calls)
- added data/lists directory to installation
- added docs/admin.howto to show how to set up an admin account
- moved adhelp/* to adhelp/en/* to make admin dirs language sensitive
- renamed directory 'admin' to 'ahelp'
- changed ADMIN_DIR to AHELP_DIR and adhelp_dir to ahelp_dir
[AvK]
- comproc.c :com_who() changed some -1's to 0
  (an unsigned was assigned -1,or compared to -1)
  This assumes that no lower ranks than 30k exist.
- com_help(), com_adhelp(): replaced popen("ls -C") by
  search_index(), first attempt to do multi-column formatting...
- removed some #ifdeffed out code. More to go.
- Reshuffled some FILENAME_xxx #defines, to make help/ahelp
  work. Some of the code relies on:
  #define FILENAME_HELP_l_index (FILENAME_HELP_l+5)
  etcetera. It's a bit ugly, but it works...
- added #ifdefs to language.[ch] to avoid preprocessor-redef warnings.
- changed some manifest constants to sizeof's
- fixed the helpdirs/init. Now, *both* help/ and ahelp/ are supposed
  to have language subdirs (en, ch, ge, etc). At initialisation time,
  an .index is created in each of these dirs, containing the names
  of the available helpitems. This list includes *both* the language
  itself, and english. (So if a helpfile is absent in the particular
  language, but is present in english, it will be listed, and shown)
- help_init() is now called explicitely at startup.
- added spaces in the VARS: line in the player file, for countability.
  it seems to parse OK.



1.1.9  2001-06-26
[AvK]
- added french and polish to language definitions so they can be used
- fixed language-dependent helpfiles. If no helpfile
  for the particular language is found, the LANGUAGE_DEFAULT
  is tried. This also involves search_directory, which has been
  replaced by search_index. At program init an .index file
  is written into each language subdir.
  For the admin-commands, things remain the same. (english only)
- added a few cases (and some goto's) to pvafopen. please don't tell EWD :-)
- changed a few instances of FILENAME_s_s to FILENAME_cs_s
  (for player-dir one-letter subdirs)
- added two more languages (polish+french) to the switches.
  created a struct for the  languages to live in.
- created xyopendir(), wrapper around opendir()
- got rid of some const warnings. Still more to go ...
- fixed emote2.c. It works now, it seems.
- removed some more unneeded typedefs. Only mink.[ch] is left
  unaltered. Next step will be cleaning up the headers,
  and moving the struct {} to the corresponding .c files,
  if the callers only need an incomlete type.
- compacted the com_shout() and com_gshout() functions.
- #ifdeffed out some unused functions. Once ok, someone should clean up.
- remove more pathname-construction from the code)
  - created the xpsend_command() function.
- did some renaming, for clarity.
- removed one more (cast*)malloc
- etc.



1.1.8  2001-06-11
[Nils]
- added german message translation
- data/messages: added default.logout
- data/help: separated all four languages
- data/Makefile.am: use this makefile to install all sublevels
- removed data/*/Makefile*; no longer necessary
[Sean Dwyer  <ewe2@can.org.au>]
- nrat/comproc.c:5434 added -ta -la options to fix intergo translation
  problems, but translate command probably needs some verbiage avoidance
  logic. possibly only a problem for newer versions of intergo.
- nrat/*.c made sure that <dmalloc.h> is included LAST
- toplevel configure.in: added logic for MAILPROGRAM, ADMINLEVELS and dmalloc.
- toplevel acconfig.h: added MAILPROGRAM and ADMINLEVELS, also USING_DMALLOC.
- src/nngsconfig.h: commented out the MAILPROGRAM defines and added config.h
  logic for extra stuff.
- src/*.c make sure that <dmalloc.h> is included LAST.
[AvK]
- fix the char[xxx] -variables-problems.
  (I don't know where the empty values for parray[].name,password,et al
  came from. Given the Logit() in the source, they must be a known problem.
  could you take look at the older srcs, for a rough indication when they
  started ?
- split the long arglist for variables into manageable chunks of 8.
  (there is some ansi/posix limit, 16 IIRC)
- created the framework for language-dependant message-dirs.
  Basic scheme is, that subdirectories can be created below mess_dir,
  named "ch" , "de", and a symlink named "en"
  # ln -fs ./ en
  does the trick for me.
  The abbreviations should have corresponding code
  in language.c:language_prefix()
- Removed the PUBLIC / PRIVATE braindamage
- (for grep-ability) renamed parray.name -> parray.pname
- Created UNUSED() macro to shut off warnings concerning unused
  function arguments. Compiles a lot cleaner now. :-)
- Fixed some AdminLevels being compared to non-#defined constants.
- Unified channel/ochannel code, combined some globals.
  The ochannels are now located at channelnumber 100 and above
- fixed some instances of if(!parray[p].name), which had been
  changed from pointer to array. The same for most char[] members
  of the parray struct.
- reorganised the two-column "who" code. It is a bit smaller now ...
  (but still ugly)
- replaced some more sprintf(filename,...), ... lines, by xyfunction()s
- player_save(): split up long fprintf() into many smaller ones.
- removed some more struct typedefs
- removed some useless casts: "if ((int) strlen(cp) < 3)"
- etc.
[Nicol Schraudolph <schraudo@inf.ethz.ch>]
- added SGF territory recording in saved games via 'TB' and 'TW' tags



1.1.7  2001-05-18
- WARNING: This version is alpha quality due to the many changes!!
- NOTE: If you find it's close to beta-stable, you're lucky :)
- translation hacked in in part courtesy of LGS server code
- this version is the first in a series intended to get many NNGS
  based servers to use a common source code again to speed up
  development and allow all to profit from it
[AvK]
- Language
  New files: src/utils.[ch]
  new command: com_language()
  replaced *most of* the pprinf(int p,char *format, ...) calls
  by pcn_out(int p,int num,...)
  enumerated all formats in utils/formats.h
  merged chinese translation.
- enumerated filenames/dirnames.
  new function FILE * xyfopen(int num, ...) opens files, and handles pathname
  construction. It should replace xfopen(), eventually.
  removed most of the oldstyle fileopening.
- wrapped crypt() into mycrypt() to allow workaround for
  platforms with broken crypt()
- altered command_list, added qsort(), now the list doesn't have to
  be sorted alphabetically, and commands can be grouped.
- MISC:
  - removed some innecessary casts. ((int) TYPE_INT)
  - did some renaming, to make command-parsing more readable.
  - replaced some more #defined constants by sizeof
  - removed some more while(!feof()) { braindamage ; }
  - changed some more : if(parray[p].admin_level)
    to if(parray[p].admin_level >= ADMIN_ADMIN),  etc
  - altered who_terse to mimic 1.1.2 style output.
  - removed some typedef's for structs. C is not C++ :-)
  - available_space() now returns space in K. To avoid wraparound on
    larger filesystems. It seems to be unused, though :-)


1.1.6  2001-03-29
[AvK]
- renamed nrat/code.h to nrat/servercodes.h
  Moved the server-state codes (WAITING,PLAYING,...) to this file,
  renamed them to STAT_WAITING, etc.
- changed do_copy() semantics (off by one)
  now it should be safe to do:
  char buff[xxx]; do_copy( buff, "blablablablabla", sizeof buff);
- changed all do_copy(a,b,xxx) to do_copy(a,b, sizeof a)
  (note: this will fail of course if a is a pointer ...)
- fixed fopen ("*/players_dir/*") to use global char * stats_dir instead.
- replaced all fopen() s by xfopen()
- removed most of the Logit("Could not open file ...") calls. this is handled
  by xopen, now.
- new function xfopen(). It performs fopen(), but does logging, too.
  If global mode_for_dirs is set, it will create nonexisting directories
  in the path, but only for write-mode opens.
- added some more global pathnames stuff.
- removed some innecessary casts.
- changed some if(pointer != NULL) into if(pointer)
- the same for if(pointer == NULL) into (!pointer)
- added #ifdef __linux__ case for fsstat() freespace calculation.
- etc.



1.1.5  2001-03-19
- moved memory code (malloc.* salloc.*) into memory/* and made it a .a
- made some functions static in mink.c to avoid warnings
- created hash dirs under player and game dirs.  How many more are missing?
- added docs/portforwarding
- added 'tags' target to Makefile.am
- warning cleanups
[AvK]
- fixed the missing prompt on login.
- rewrote emote2.c (new file) in C It does not work as expected yet
  but it seems stable ...
- avoided the while(!feof(fp)) {} stuff, replaced by while(fgets())
- removed some globally visible typedeffed structs.
- replaced (hopefully) all strdup() by mystrdup().
- removed (potentially dangerous) casts of malloc()s returnvalue
  and included stdlib.h where necessary.
- renamed client - #defines IGC -> CLIENT_IGC, etc.
- various cleanup of "bad" style
- removed some avoidable strlen() s, etc.
- added some pathnames/constants for SERVER_HTTP, etc.
NOTE:
- there are loads of warnings about "const" omitted, and unused
  args for some of the com_xxx().



1.1.4  2001-03-13
- patched segfault in 'uptime' command if ladder files are bad
- added default ladder9 and ladder19 files to installation
- added Makefile.am to data/ladder
- renamed all files that are generated or customized to either
   default.filename (message/*) or filename.example (ladder/*)
- fixed to build on cygwin >= 1.1.8 (Jens Yllman <jens.yllman@swipnet.se>)
- do not use malloc() and salloc() for cygwin
- added #ifdef __CYGWIN__ typedef unsigned long ulong; to mink.h
- removed all header files from stdincludes.h (faster compiles, cleaner)
    required ones are in the .c and .h files that need them
- removed stdincludes.h: no longer needed
    ulong comes from sys/types.h or is defined in mink.h for CYGWIN
- removed glue.h and added contents to nngsmain.h
- cleaned header files out of .h files in nrat/*.c
- BASICALLY: major header reorganization to have minimal includes everywhere
- changed remaining two ASSERT() calls to assert()
- commented out ASSERT() and SWAP() calls in common.h
- removed salloc.h include from common.h: should be included individually
- added NNGS_ALL_WARNINGS to Makefiles- plenty of stuff to clean up!
- put PEMs malloc and salloc code in #ifdef USE_PEM_MALLOC- see config.h
   for now #define it manually in config.h if desired
[AvK]
- large patch from (A van Kessel <Adriaan.van.Kessel@rivm.nl>)
0) nrat/playerdb.h:
	changed names of #defines (ERROR,INFO,MOVE, etc)
	into CODE_ERROR, CODE_INFO,CODE_MOVE, etc	
	put these into a new file "code.h"
	this should make things a bit more greppable

1) xxxproc.c: changed pprintf(p,"%sXXXX", SendCode(p, NAME), ...)
	into cpprintf(p, CODE_NAME, "XXXX", ...)
	similar for pprint_prompt() -> cpprint_prompt()
	( I needed to split some pprintf()s into two, because they
	started with "\n", or they contained 2 SendCode()s )

2) utils.c /utils.h:
	created cpprintf() and cpprint_prompt(). These take the
	igs - result code as their 2nd argument.
	NOTE: I don't know if my use of varargs passing is correct
	there. Please check.

3) utils.c: changed some
	char buff[LINE_MAX ];
	fgets(buff,LINE_MAX, fd);
	into
	char buff[LINE_MAX ];
	fgets(buff,sizeof buff, fd);
	this should be more robust.


1.1.3  2001-03-05
- changed GNUGO references in configure.in to NNGS
- more details for path definitions in configure.h
- added 'data' subdir with all default files that need to be there
   help info admin messages
- got all files from data/* to be installed in $datadir
- moved filename definitions from nngsmain.h to configure.in
- nngsmain.c: removed duplicate port code: the server only runs on one port


1.1.2  2001-03-04
- moved FILE + DIR definitions from nngsconfig.h and addded to configure.in
- added "config.h" to most files as a result


1.1.1  2001-01-04
- fixed compilation with mlrate 1.0.4 (libmlr.a)
- better logfile error messages
- removed unnecessary LINUX prototypes from .h files; now autoconf'ed
- removed GOOD_STDIO definition: not used, and replaced by autoconf


1.1.0  2001-01-03
- autoconf/header/make used for building
- moved source code into src/ dir
- moved unused code into oldsrc/ dir
- created docs/ dir and put autotool doc into it
- dbm code in nrat/*c is broken (at least for non-linux)


1.0.0
- initial NNGS Server code from http://nngs.cosmic.org/src
  Version: NNGS #1623 Tue Dec 26 08:59:39 CST 2000
